    <h2>About The Wormhole</h2>
    <p>
        The Wormhole (Valley Library and Remote) is a Physics Collaboration and Help Center.
        It is an informal space to work on physics with your peers under the guidance of
        experienced Assistants.
    </p>
    <p>
        If your group needs help with a physics question, send a request to the queue.
        Only one person in the group needs to enter the request. You can check your position
        in the help queue using the “Live Queue” link above.

    <h2>Wormhole Assistants</h2>
    <p>
        Wormhole Assistants are graduate students in physics, physics majors,
        or other undergraduates who completed the introductory physics sequence.
        They can guide you, but may refer you to another Assistant or instructor.
