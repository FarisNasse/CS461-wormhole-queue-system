            <h2>About The Wormhole</h2>
            <p>
                The Wormhole (Valley Library and Remote) is a 
                Physics Collaboration and Help Center. Wormhole
                 is an informal space to work on physics with 
                 your peers under the guidance of experienced 
                 Assistants. Complete instructions for the 
                 Wormhole are in Wormhole Instructions. </p>
            <p>
                If you or your group needs help with a physics
                question, send a request to the queue. In 
                person, use the box on your table. Online, use 
                the Submit link at the top of this page. Only 
                one person in the group needs to enter the 
                request, and only one timer for each question 
                please. You can see your place in the help 
                queue using the Live Queue link at the top of
                the page. Multiple requests for a question won't 
                get you help any faster, and it slows down the 
                process for everyone.

            <h2>Wormhole Assistants</h2>
            <p>
                Wormhole assistants are graduate students in physics, 
                physics majors, or other undergraduates who took one 
                of the introductory physics sequences. They all have 
                a level of expertise in physics, but they're not 
                experts on your course. When asking question, be prepared 
                to show them the problem you're working on. They'll do 
                their best to answer it but may ultimately refer you to 
                another Wormhole Assistant or to your course instructor. 
                If your question is course related (e.g. How do we use the 
                analysis app in lab?) you should look for a Wormhole 
                Assistant affiliated with your course, as shown in 
                the schedule.

            <h2>Virtual Wormhole</h2>
            <p>
                The Virtual Wormhole allows you to request help remotely. 
                You can get help through two different methods:
            </p>
            <ul id = "Virtual-Methods">
                <li>
                    Connect to the Virtual Wormhole channel in the Introductory 
                    Physics MS Team. (Full instructions for joining the Team are 
                    in <a href = "">MS Teams instructions</a>.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Join the Wormhole Zoom session 
                    <a href = "">here</a> 
                    (password is set to "Wormhole"), and go to the breakout room 
                    associated with your course. You must be logged in through 
                    OSU to use either MS Teams or the Zoom session.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section class = "Main-Page">
            <h2>Requesting Assistance</h2>
            <p>
                In the Wormhole use the box on your table. Simply push the button 
                for your course to be put in the queue. In the Virtual Wormhole 
                enter a request at (LINK). An Assistant will respond to your 
                request as soon as your turn comes up in the queue. Help is 
                provided in the order requests are received. You can check the 
                status of your request at (LINK).

            <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
            <p>
                The Wormhole is an informal space for physics collaboration. It 
                works best when we accord each other common courtesy.
            </p>
            <ul id = "Code-of-Conduct">
                <li>Be respectful of other students.</li>
                <li>Respect others' personal and work spaces.</li>
                <li>Be conscious of aromas.</li>
                <li>Be aware of your speech.</li>
                <li>Respect those who will use the space next.</li>
                <li>Be mindful of the learning environment.</li>
                <li>Be respectful of the Assistants</li>
                <li>Be patient - the Assistants will help as many people as possible.</li>
                <li>Remember that Assistants assist. They are there to help you learn, 
                    not to do the problem or to tell you the answer.</li>
                <li>Assistants will try to help everyone, but be patient when they 
                    aren't familiar with the problem in your course.</li>
                <li>The Wormhole get crowded. If you're not working on physics, please 
                    give up your space to those who are.</li>
